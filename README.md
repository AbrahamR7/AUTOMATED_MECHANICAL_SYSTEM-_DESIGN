# AUTOMATED_MECHANICAL_SYSTEM_DESIGN

 ###  Introduction

   The object of this project is that we are going to study and develop a “Cut-off machine”. In this project we are going to utilize three different functional groups by labeling them by groups (Motion curve-01) or MC01, (Motion curve-02) or MC02 and (Motion curve 03) or MC03 Which are the feeding group, pressing group and cutting group, respectively. 
Each of these function group has a specific total rise. Cutting length can vary between 60 to 160 mm. Total rise of MC02 and Total rise of MC03 are 5mm and 15mm sequentially (H02=5 mm, H03=15 mm). As it has been assigned for us the diameter of the wire to be cut is 6 mm and material is AISI 1040 (C40). Productivity varies from 30 to 90 products per minute.
